# Zero_ProductFeed

The store's catalog as XML feeds that marketplaces,
price comparison sites and ad platforms fetch by URL: Rozetka and Prom.ua
(YML), Hotline, Google Merchant Center (which Meta catalogs read too). One
feed per store view, in its own language and currency, at
{store URL}/productfeed/{rozetka|prom|hotline|google}.

## Install

Requires Magento Open Source 2.4.7–2.4.9 and PHP 8.2–8.4 with the GD extension built with WebP (`php -r 'var_dump(function_exists("imagewebp"));'` says `true`; Magento's own PHP requirements cover the rest). Without WebP in GD, Zero skips its WebP image copies and serves the originals.

```bash
composer require zerofront/module-zero-product-feed
bin/magento setup:upgrade
bin/magento setup:di:compile           # production mode
bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy # production mode
bin/magento cache:flush
```

Composer installs `zerofront/module-zero-core` with it.

Part of [`zerofront/zero`](https://zerofront.dev), which installs the Zero theme and every Zero module at once.
